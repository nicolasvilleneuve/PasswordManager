## PasswordManager
A GUI with the ability to generate passwords for you and store them in a file for you.

## Description
The following app is very straight forward.

but also to make that data accessible if you want to search for it (Fig 2) (which you can do by only filling in the website in the Website text box and pressing search, which will make
the credentials for that website pop up in a prompt window).

## Usage
You can freely access this app so long as you have a version of python 3 (this was made in python 3.9.1), the tkinter module, and the images from the images folder of the presenr repository. With those, you should simply be able to run the code and have a visually-appeasing timer to hold you accountable for/encourage your productivity. 

## Contributing / Support
If you would like to create a PULL request, please feel free. Whether the intent be to pilfer from the code as you like some elements of the app, or to suggest improvements, you are most welcome to. If the changes are to be major, however, please open an issue first so we can discuss if/what you would like to change. Should you have a problem in doing so, please feel free to let me know (my email is on my website so please find it there in case it has changed since writing this).
